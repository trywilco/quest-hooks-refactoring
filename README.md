# quest-hooks-refactoring

In this quest user needs to take [React class components](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html) and refactoring it into [React functional components](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-function-component/):

Step 1:
We have a simple comonent: `Header.jsx` with no state at all, the user need to make it a functional component.
User will do it with opening a PR, where we check that the component's unit test is working + that now the component is a function

Step 2:
We have a little more complex compnent: `CommentInput.jsx` with a state and callback, the user need to make it a functional component.
User will do it with opening a PR, where we check that the component's unit test is working + that now the component is a function


Bullet points: 
-	Refactoring a simple class component into a functional component with React Hooks 
-	Refactoring a complex class component into a functional component with React Hooks, Props
