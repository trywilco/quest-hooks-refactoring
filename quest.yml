subtitle: Hooks of Change
description: These days, people who write React apps prefer to use Hooks in functional components instead of using class components. Why? Hooks allow developers to write cleaner code with less boilerplate and reuse stateful behavior between components. But what can you do if you’ve inherited messy legacy code? You refactor, of course! In this quest, you’ll learn to refactor a React app using Hooks. At the end of the day, you’ll have an app with code that’s easier to read and reuse — saving you time in the future.
summary: Congratulations! You now know how to modernize pre-React 16 apps by refactoring them to use Hooks, making their code easier to work with.
